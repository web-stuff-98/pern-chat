# Project Title

This is PERN-Chat. It is my portfolio fullstack project. It's a chat app with rooms and direct messaging where you can share video and image attachments. The code is based on my last project which was called MongoDB-stuff. MongoDB-stuff doesn't exist anymore because it was running on the heroku free tier and create-react-app, which was quite slow. I was planned to add WebRTC video chat to this project but I don't have a webcam to test it with and I need to spend time doing other stuff. This is my first project using PostgreSQL.
